        "\n",
        "-->Measures of central tendency are statistical metrics that describe the center point or typical value of a dataset. The three main measures are the mean, median, and mode. Each has its own strengths and is appropriate in different situations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Mean\n",
        "The mean, or average, is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the number of values. It is useful when you want to find the overall trend of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example**: Consider the dataset: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.\n",
        "- Mean = (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6\n",
        "\n",
        "**When to Use**: The mean is appropriate when the data is symmetrically distributed without outliers. It is sensitive to extreme values, so it may not be suitable for skewed distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Median\n",
        "The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is ordered from least to greatest. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Mode\n",
        "The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have more than one mode if multiple values have the same highest frequency.\n",

        "- Mode = 4 (appears most frequently)\n",

        "**When to Use**: The mode is useful for categorical data where you want to know the most common category. It is also helpful when the most frequent value is of interest, regardless of the distribution shape.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Situations and Examples\n",
        "1. **Mean**: Use the mean to calculate the average score of students in a class when the scores are normally distributed.\n",
        "2. **Median**: Use the median to determine the typical income in a region where a few extremely high incomes might skew the average.\n",
        "3. **Mode**: Use the mode to find the most common shoe size sold in a store.\n",
